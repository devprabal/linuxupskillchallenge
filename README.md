My progress on [r/linuxupskillchallenge](www.reddit.com/r/linuxupskillchallenge) using [AWS](aws) and [VirtualBox](VirtualBox).

The [VirtualBox](VirtualBox) dir contains more details on tasks for each day and it was the first time I had taken the course. So, I recommend viewing the files therein first. 

The [AWS](aws) dir only has some important points while revisiting the course with a cloud server.
