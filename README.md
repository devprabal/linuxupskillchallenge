> I took the course in **September, 2020**. Most of the things would change over time and this repo is **not** meant to keep a track of any of the changes. _It is my learning_. However, most things would have a similar concept too, even if they are on the newer-tech front. You can have a look around and learn too.

My progress on [r/linuxupskillchallenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxupskillchallenge/) using [AWS](aws) and [VirtualBox](VirtualBox).

The [VirtualBox](VirtualBox) dir contains more details on tasks for each day and it was the first time I had taken the course. So, I recommend viewing the files therein first. 

The [AWS](aws) dir only has some important points while revisiting the course with a cloud server.
