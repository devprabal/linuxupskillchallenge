# Day 0

## Notes

- [x] Set up VirtualBox Ubuntu Server 20.04

- [ ] Failed to set up VM on digital ocean (they don't accept debit cards)

- [ ] Failed to set up VM on aws (though they have accepted debit card, yet somehow the registration doesn't proceed forward and it keeps asking for card information)

- [ ] Failed to set up Arch Linux on VirtualBox again. (thought it was not require for this course, yet I thought I would be getting some hands-on on Arch too. But it seems Arch is still not anywhere near to me.)
