# Day 21

## Notes

- [ ] Keep working with the server.
- [ ] Maybe uninstall Apache2 and install NGINX, a competing webserver. 
- [ ] Keep a running stat on ssh “attackers”.
- [ ] installing and running your own instance of Minecraft, Wordpress WireGuard VPN or Mediawiki.

## Readings

- [ ] Spend your free “surfing” time avoiding articles on Gnome, KDE or i3 – and checking out any articles like “20 Linux commands every sysadmin should know”. 

Three certs that matter - 
1. [CompTIA Linux+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/linux)
2. [LPI LPIC-1: Linux Administrator](https://wiki.lpi.org/wiki/Main_Page)
3. [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/all-certifications-exams)
